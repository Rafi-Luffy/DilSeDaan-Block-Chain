## üìú Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at conduct@dilsedaan.com.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git installed and configured
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and Node.js
- Understanding of blockchain concepts (for Web3 features)
- Familiarity with charitable/NGO operations (helpful but not required)

### Setup Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Visit https://github.com/your-username/DilSeDaan and click "Fork"
   ```

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DilSeDaan.git
   cd DilSeDaan
   ```

3. **Set up upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/DilSeDaan.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies and start development**
   ```bash
   ./start-dilsedaan.sh install
   ./start-dilsedaan.sh
   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We use GitFlow branching model:
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `hotfix/issue-description` - Critical bug fixes
- `release/version-number` - Release preparation

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ... code, test, commit ...

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(campaigns): add campaign sharing functionality
fix(payments): resolve Razorpay webhook validation issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(frontend): fix linting errors in HomePage component
refactor(backend): optimize database queries for campaigns
test(auth): add unit tests for authentication service
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- **ESLint Configuration**: Follow the existing ESLint rules
- **Prettier Formatting**: Code must be formatted with Prettier
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strictly, avoid `any` types
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Components: PascalCase (`HomePage`, `DonationForm`)
  - Functions/Variables: camelCase (`getUserData`, `isLoggedIn`)
  - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL`)
  - Files: kebab-case (`user-profile.tsx`, `email-service.ts`)

### React Components

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface Props {
  campaignId: string;
  onDonate: (amount: number) => void;
}

export const DonationButton: React.FC<Props> = ({ campaignId, onDonate }) => {
  const [amount, setAmount] = useState<number>(0);
  
  const handleDonate = useCallback(() => {
    onDonate(amount);
  }, [amount, onDonate]);

  return (
    <button onClick={handleDonate} className="btn-primary">
      Donate ‚Çπ{amount}
    </button>
  );
};

// ‚ùå Avoid
export const DonationButton = (props: any) => {
  // ... component logic
};
```

### Backend API

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface CreateCampaignRequest {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  targetAmount: number;
  category: CampaignCategory;
}

export const createCampaign = async (
  req: Request<{}, {}, CreateCampaignRequest>,
  res: Response
): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    const { title, description, targetAmount, category } = req.body;
    
    // Validate input
    if (!title || !description || targetAmount <= 0) {
      res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid campaign data' });
      return;
    }
    
    // Create campaign
    const campaign = await Campaign.create({
      title,
      description,
      targetAmount,
      category,
      createdBy: req.user.id
    });
    
    res.status(201).json({ success: true, campaign });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Campaign creation error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
};
```

### Database Models

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface ICampaign extends Document {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  targetAmount: number;
  raisedAmount: number;
  category: CampaignCategory;
  status: CampaignStatus;
  createdBy: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

const campaignSchema = new Schema<ICampaign>({
  title: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 200 },
  description: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 5000 },
  targetAmount: { type: Number, required: true, min: 100 },
  raisedAmount: { type: Number, default: 0, min: 0 },
  category: { type: String, enum: Object.values(CampaignCategory), required: true },
  status: { type: String, enum: Object.values(CampaignStatus), default: CampaignStatus.PENDING },
  createdBy: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true }
}, {
  timestamps: true,
  toJSON: { virtuals: true },
  toObject: { virtuals: true }
});
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements

    const amount = 1000;
    const expectedFee = 30; // 3% platform fee
    
    expect(calculateDonationFee(amount)).toBe(expectedFee);
  });
  
  it('should handle zero amount', () => {
    expect(calculateDonationFee(0)).toBe(0);
  });
});

// Component test example
describe('DonationButton', () => {
  it('should call onDonate with correct amount', () => {
    const mockOnDonate = jest.fn();
    const { getByRole } = render(
      <DonationButton campaignId="123" onDonate={mockOnDonate} />
    );
    
    fireEvent.click(getByRole('button'));
