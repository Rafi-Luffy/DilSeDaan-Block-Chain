## 🛠️ CRITICAL BUG FIXES - USER DASHBOARD

### 13. UserDashboard PaymentMethod Error Fix ✅
**Issue**: TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'donation.paymentMethod.toUpperCase')

- ✅ **Fallback Value**: Shows 'UPI' when paymentMethod is undefined
- ✅ **Error Prevention**: Eliminated TypeError that was breaking the dashboard

**Technical Fix**:
```tsx
// Before (causing error):
Payment Method: {donation.paymentMethod.toUpperCase()}

// After (safe access):
Payment Method: {donation.paymentMethod ? donation.paymentMethod.toUpperCase() : 'UPI'}
```
