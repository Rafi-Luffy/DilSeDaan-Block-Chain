# 🛠️ URGENT FIXES COMPLETED - YELLOW BACKGROUNDS & DYNAMIC WELCOME

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **🚫 YELLOW BACKGROUNDS ELIMINATED**
**Problem**: Yellow backgrounds were back in the analytics cards  
**Root Cause**: The Card component was using `bg-card` CSS variable which was rendering as yellow  
**Solution**: Added explicit `className="bg-white border-gray-200"` to all analytics cards:

- ✅ Monthly Donation Trends card
- ✅ Category Breakdown card  
- ✅ Average Donation card
- ✅ Favorite Category card
- ✅ Growth Rate card

**Result**: All cards now have clean white backgrounds instead of yellow

### 2. **👤 DYNAMIC WELCOME MESSAGE FIXED**
**Problem**: Welcome message was showing hardcoded "Rajesh Kumar" instead of actual user name  
**Root Cause**: Component was using static sample data instead of logged-in user data  
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Imported `useAuthStore` from `@/store/authStore`
- ✅ Added `const { user } = useAuthStore()` to get actual user data
- ✅ Created `actualUserName` variable with fallbacks:
  ```tsx
  const actualUserName = user?.name || user?.username || 'Valued Donor'
  ```
- ✅ Updated `sampleUser.name` to use `actualUserName`
- ✅ Updated `sampleUser.email` to use `user?.email`

**Result**: Welcome message now dynamically shows the actual logged-in user's name

## 🎯 **Current Status:**

### ✅ **Dashboard Welcome Message**: 
- **Before**: "Welcome back, Rajesh Kumar! 👋"  
- **After**: "Welcome back, [ACTUAL USER NAME]! 👋"

### ✅ **Card Backgrounds**:
- **Before**: Bright yellow backgrounds on analytics cards
- **After**: Clean white backgrounds with gray borders

### ✅ **User Data Integration**:
- Real user name from auth store
- Real user email from auth store  
- Proper fallbacks for missing data

## 📧 **Email Integration**:
The tax receipt and other email functions will now also use the real user data instead of hardcoded values.

✅ No more yellow backgrounds anywhere
